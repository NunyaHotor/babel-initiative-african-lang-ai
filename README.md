# The Babel Initiative

An open-source AI project building direct translation models between African languages to preserve endangered heritage and foster connectivity, bypassing colonial intermediaries.

## 🎯 Mission & Vision

To develop a scalable, culturally-aware AI system that enables accurate, direct translation between African languages without using English, French, or other colonial languages as a pivot. Our goal is to create a technological foundation for linguistic preservation and intra-African connectivity, combating language extinction and promoting digital sovereignty.

## 🤔 The Problem & Our Approach
### The Crisis

Over 300 African languages are endangered (UNESCO). Dominant translation technology often excludes them or forces them through European-language pipelines, distorting meaning and accelerating cultural erosion.
### Our Solution

We build direct, **low-resource translation models focused** on African language families. We prioritize community-sourced data, the integration of oral tradition, and ethical AI practices to ensure translations are accurate and culturally resonant.
## 🌍 Why This Matters

This project is about more than technology:

**Preservation:**  Turns endangered languages into living digital resources.

**Access:** Powers mother-tongue education, local media, and cross-border services.

**Sovereignty:** Fosters an ecosystem of African-led language technology.

## 🛠️ Project Status

This repository is in the early planning and research phase. We are currently:

    Defining project architecture and technical goals.

    Researching available datasets and methods for low-resource African languages.

    Building a community of contributors and partners.
